*odpdown.txt* *ShowSlides* Plugin to write presentations as markdown

The following commands are available from the odpdown plugin:

:ShowSlides show                generates a presentation from the markdown in
                                the current buffer and opens the result with
                                LibreOffice. If run repeatedly, the previous
                                result is replaced in LibreOffice (so the
                                previous result is closed), unless it was
                                modified.
